# HDDBench

This is a simple bash script to determine HDD write/read speed under Linux/MacOS. Simply run ```sh HDDBench.sh path```, where *path* is a path for the test file to be written (e.g. "." or "/" or "/tmp" or "/dev/sda1" etc.) The path argument allows for several devices to be tested without moving the script.

Use at your own risk.
